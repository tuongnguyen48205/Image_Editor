# Small Python Projects
This repository stores a few python projects ranging from hobby programs to hackethon/competition submissions.

Image Editor:
An image editing software using the programming language Python. This code was submitted as part of a competition to see what sort of program could be created in a span of 20 minutes. An image editor seemed like a logical program to make as it has a very practical application.
